Your knowledge base is ready to publish the moment you merge a Markdown file into the repository. This welcome guide highlights the
core experience and shows how to help teammates find the answers they need.

## What lives here?

The site automatically indexes every Markdown document stored inside the `docs/` directory. Articles are grouped by category, tagged for
search, and listed on the home page with a short summary. Because the content lives alongside your code, you can review, version, and
audit every change without leaving your normal workflow.

## Navigating the site

1. **Home page.** The landing page surfaces search, popular tags, and key onboarding information so visitors can quickly locate the
   right resource.
2. **Search & filters.** Type a keyword to filter results instantly, or click a tag to narrow the list to a specific topic.
3. **Article view.** Each article displays metadata, reading time, and a dynamic table of contents generated from headings.

> Tip: Use descriptive titles and headings in your Markdown files—the site converts them into navigation anchors automatically.

## Recommended conventions

- **Keep descriptions concise.** A one or two sentence summary in the front matter gives readers context before they click.
- **Use categories intentionally.** Think in terms of the questions visitors ask (for example, *Start Here*, *How-To*, *Operations*).
- **Leverage tags.** Tags make it easy to group related content across categories. Aim for one to five per article.
- **Document ownership.** Add a section at the end of each article noting who maintains it and how to request updates.

## Beyond the basics

Need custom behaviour? Extend the repository just like any static site. You can add analytics, integrate a feedback form, or embed
videos—all while keeping authoring as simple as committing Markdown. If you want to personalise the theme, adjust `css/knowledge-base.css`
and commit the changes.
